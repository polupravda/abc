# Games to Curriculum Mapping (Primary 1–2)

This document maps each game in the app to the **Primary 1–2 (Lower Primary)** topic list. Games that do not fit the list are grouped in **Other categories**.

## Primary 1–2 (Lower Primary) Topics

### 1️⃣ Numbers & Basic Operations

| Topic | Game(s) | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Counting (to 1000)** | **Build 1000** | The child drags ones (unit cubes), tens (rods), and hundreds (flats) from a palette onto a mat. The total updates live. They explore how 10 ones become 1 ten and 10 tens become 1 hundred. No correctness check. |
| **Counting (to 1000)** | **Count by clusters** | A grid or organic layout shows several groups of the same object (e.g. stars, hearts). Each group has the same number of items. The user must count the number of groups and the number per group, enter both values in two boxes, and verify. |
| **Place value / visual representation** | **Which picture shows number up to 100?** | The game shows a visual representation of a number (e.g. pink/yellow squares for tens and ones up to 100). The user must choose which of three numbers matches the picture. |
| **Comparing and ordering numbers** | **Greater or Less** | A vertical slider and a comparison (e.g. "5 > ?") are shown. The user drags the slider to choose a number and verifies whether the relationship (>, <, or =) is true. |
| **Comparing and ordering numbers** | **Fewer, more, or same?** | Two sets of icons (e.g. stars on the left, hearts on the right) are shown with different counts. The user chooses whether the left has fewer, more, or the same as the right. |
| **Addition (without regrouping)** | **Addition up to 10** | Two numbers are shown in boxes with a '+' sign between them; the sum does not exceed 10. The user types the sum and verifies. |
| **Addition (without regrouping)** | **Add 3 numbers (to 10)** | Three numbers are shown with '+' between them; the total is at most 10. The user types the sum and verifies. |
| **Addition (with/without regrouping)** | **Addition up to 100 (no carrying)** | Two two-digit numbers are shown with a '+' sign; the ones digits sum to 9 or less (no carry). The user enters the sum and verifies. |
| **Addition (with regrouping)** | **Addition up to 100 (with carrying)** | Two two-digit numbers are shown with a '+' sign; the ones digits sum to 10 (carry to tens). The user enters the sum and verifies. |
| **Subtraction** | **Subtraction up to 10** | Two numbers are shown with a '−' sign; the second is not larger than the first. The user types the difference and verifies. |
| **Number bonds** | **Number Bonds** | A number bond diagram shows a target number (e.g. 8) and one given part (e.g. 3). The user must enter the missing part (e.g. 5) using a keypad or input and verify. |
| **Mental math strategies** | **+/- Number** | A row of shapes (e.g. circles) is shown, then an operation (+ or −) and a change (e.g. +3). Three options show different resulting counts. The user picks the array that shows the correct result. |

### 2️⃣ Multiplication & Division (Intro)

| Topic | Game(s) | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Concept of equal groups / repeated addition** | **Multiplication Arrays** | The user enters two dimensions (X and Y). The app displays an X×Y array of squares and shows the product (e.g. "4 × 3 = 12"). Exploratory; no correctness check. |
| **Simple division as sharing/grouping** | **Divide chocolate bar** | A chocolate bar is split into a given number of sections (e.g. 8). A number of kids is shown. The user enters how many pieces each kid gets so that the bar is shared equally, then verifies. |

---

### 3️⃣ Fractions (Intro)

| Topic | Game(s) | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Halves and quarters / simple visual fractions** | **Fractions of a block** | The user sets a denominator and numerator. A rectangular block is shown divided into that many equal parts, with the given number of parts shaded. Exploratory; no correctness check. |
| **Simple visual fractions** | **Fractions of a circle** | The user sets a denominator and numerator. A circle is shown divided into that many equal sectors, with the given number of sectors shaded. Exploratory; no correctness check. |

### 4️⃣ Measurement

*No games in the app currently map to Measurement (length, mass, volume, time, money).*

---

### 5️⃣ Geometry

| Topic | Game(s) | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Coordinates** | **Coordinates** | An interactive coordinate grid (e.g. 0–10 on X and Y) is shown. The user can click to add points and drag to move them. A list of coordinates is displayed. Exploratory; no correctness check. |
| **Coordinates / position** | **Plotting points** | A target coordinate (e.g. "X: 5  Y: 6") is shown. The user moves a pin on the grid using horizontal and vertical sliders to that point, then verifies. |
| **Coordinates / position** | **Copy coordinates** | Two grids are shown. The left has a pattern of points. The user must place the same pattern on the right grid by clicking, then verify. |

---

### 6️⃣ Data Handling

*No games in the app currently map to Data Handling (picture graphs, bar graphs).*

---

### 7️⃣ Logical Thinking Skills

| Topic | Game(s) | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Pattern recognition** | **Continue pattern** | A sequence of shapes in different colors is shown with one position missing. The user must choose which shape/color completes the pattern (by shape or by color). |
| **Ordering / position** | **Ordinal numbers (1st–10th)** | A row of shapes (e.g. star, heart, circle) is shown. The game asks which shape is in a given ordinal position (e.g. "Which shape is 3rd?"). The user selects the correct shape. |

---

## Other Categories (not in Primary 1–2 list)

### English / Literacy

| Game | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Learn Phonics** | The user clicks on letters to hear how they sound. Exploratory; no correctness check. |
| **Letter Sound Match** | A sound is played. The user must choose which letter makes that sound from several options. |
| **Blending** | The user hears or sees sounds and must blend them to form a word, then select or match the correct word. |
